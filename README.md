# Wafer-Level-Anomaly-Detection
This project evaluates three anomaly detection methods on two wafer datasets (Wafer 1 and Wafer 2) under realistic manufacturing constraints.  The emphasis is **not headline accuracy**, but model behavior, failure modes, and anomaly detection effectiveness in highly imbalanced data.
